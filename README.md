# Flight Price Prediction Model

## Overview

Welcome to the **Flight Price Prediction Model** repository. This project is focused on developing a machine learning model to predict flight prices based on various features such as departure time, arrival time, airlines, and other relevant factors. The goal is to create an accurate and reliable model that can forecast flight prices, aiding travelers, travel agencies, and financial analysts in making informed decisions.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`data/`** - Contains raw and processed datasets used for training and evaluating the model.
- **`notebooks/`** - Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and evaluation.
- **`README.md`** - This file.

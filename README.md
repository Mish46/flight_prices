Flight Price Prediction Model
Overview
Welcome to the Flight Price Prediction Model repository. This project is focused on developing a machine learning model to predict flight prices based on various features such as departure time, arrival time, airlines, and other relevant factors. The goal is to create an accurate and reliable model that can forecast flight prices, aiding travelers, travel agencies, and financial analysts in making informed decisions.

Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

data/ - Contains raw and processed datasets used for training and evaluating the model.
notebooks/ - Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and evaluation.
src/ - Source code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model implementation, and evaluation.
scripts/ - Python scripts for running experiments and generating results.
docs/ - Documentation including setup instructions, usage guidelines, and model details.
README.md - This file.

Model
The project involves several key steps:

Data Collection: Gathering flight price data and relevant features.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
Feature Engineering: Creating and selecting features that improve model performance.
Model Development: Implementing and training various machine learning algorithms to predict flight prices.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the modelâ€™s accuracy and effectiveness using performance metrics.
Results
The outcomes and findings of the model will be documented in the notebooks and the docs/ folder. This includes performance metrics, visualizations, and any insights gained from the analysis.

# Flight Price Prediction Model

## Overview

Welcome to the **Flight Price Prediction Model** repository. This project is focused on developing a machine learning model to predict flight prices based on various features such as departure time, arrival time, airlines, and other relevant factors. The goal is to create an accurate and reliable model that can forecast flight prices, aiding travelers, travel agencies, and financial analysts in making informed decisions.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`data/`** - Contains raw and processed datasets used for training and evaluating the model.
- **`notebooks/`** - The notebook for exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and evaluation.
- **`README.md`** - This file.

###Model
The project involves several key steps:

####Data Collection: Gathering flight price data and relevant features. This includes sourcing data from various platforms or APIs that provide flight information, such as prices, airlines, and travel dates.

####Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis. This step involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and normalizing data to ensure it's in a suitable format for modeling.

####Feature Engineering: Creating and selecting features that improve model performance. This includes deriving new features from existing data, such as calculating flight duration or encoding categorical variables.

####Model Development: Implementing and training various machine learning algorithms to predict flight prices. This may involve experimenting with different algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, or neural networks.

####Model Evaluation: Assessing the modelâ€™s accuracy and effectiveness using performance metrics. This includes evaluating the model's predictions against actual values using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
